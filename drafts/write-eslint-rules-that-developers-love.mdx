When I'm coding and an error squiggly appears I'm always in awe when that lightbulb saves the day with a fix that makes the error disappear.
It's part magic,
part that feeling you get when a mate helps you out with a problem you were stuck on.
I find lint rules are at their best when they keep the guard rails up,
encourage a teaching moment,
and get out of your way as fast as possible.

Have you ever wondered how these fixers work?
How about some more complicated
