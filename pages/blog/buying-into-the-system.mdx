Believe it or not I play ice hockey for fun in Sydney,
Australia.
The higher the competitive ladder you climb the more common it is to have your coach define and apply systems to the way the team plays.
Whether you're attacking or defending there are systems in place ready to execute at any given moment.
In some ways this is a pretty fitting analogy for software development,
except we replace the competitive ladder with scale,
the coach with an engineering manager or architect,
and systems,
well,
systems still work.
When you're a prospect and being scouted the coach will always push for you to ["buy into their system"](https://www.ncsasports.org/blog/2014/07/28/buy-program/),
teams in software development aren't all that different,
truly.
We all want to be aligned so we can execute with precision and speed.

What systems could we define to make UI development easier?

# Boxes and borders

Today most web developers use `box-sizing: border-box` to enable [the alternative box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#the_alternative_css_box_model) simplifying how we think about the size of an element rendered in the viewport.
Set an elements width to `100px` and it does exactly what you think it would.
But even with the alternative box model things can still be harder than we'd like them to be.
Borders for example are pretty easy to get started with,
but use them with multiple elements in different scenarios and they start behaving quite nefariously.
Let's dig in.

```
// example here showing a menu with left border for selected
```

You might be thinking,
"_Douges_,
mate,
this is easy!
You can work around this by ‚Ä¶" and honestly?
You're not wrong.
But let's look at another example first where we need multiple borders working with each other.

```
// tabs border example needing to overlay
```

More troubles.
More potential workarounds.
We need to think bigger past a single example and towards how it works with the entire system.

What if our system had borders applied using box shadow [removing the need for workarounds]?

```
// side by side example of tabs and menu with box shadow
```

# Interactions and backgrounds

Interactive UI elements like borders are simple to get started.
Pick a few different background colors,
maybe even a little transform,
and you're done.
But what would it look like when we're at ùìåùëíùí∑ ùìàùí∏ùí∂ùìÅùëí?
Let's visualize it.

```
// interaction state explosion
```

I hope you agree with me that given enough use cases things are getting pretty wild,
and we haven't even touched on UI elements that don't work with backgrounds,
such as avatars!

Given the need for varying use cases and enough scale there are a load of decisions that are vectors for mistakes,
each one slowing us down.
If we were to add a new use case what would the appropriate interaction states be?
More decisions!

What if our system had all interaction states applied as overlays [reducing decisions down to one]?

```
// example of pressable
```

# APIs and unintentional bleeds

The [not so] simple tooltip,
like borders and interaction states can seem simple to get started.
But dig in and you'll find layering and accessibility issues that you'll need to fix.
For accessibility it generally includes needing to wire up the tooltip to the target element so the tooltip can _describe_ the target element to a screen reader.
Let's wire it up.

```
// tooltip example basic to advanced
```

Now what we've made works I'm sure you can agree.
But there's something nefarious in the works that you might not realize,
any experience needing a tooltip in our system now needs to be able to take these props,
lest they suffer from an incomplete experience.
If you haven't defined this system early enough you will find friction for every unintended use,
or worse,
all of your components allowing [spread props](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#spread-attributes) enabling infinite APIs risking the [evolution of your system](/blog/taming-the-beast-that-is-css-in-js#code-evolution).

What if our system had a standardized API for all accessibility attributes [and disallowed spread props]?

```
// example of accessibility apis
```

## Layering

Layering elements on top of each other is pretty simple.
Set a few `z-index` properties and you're done!
...But not really.
It can get complex,
especially when you need portalled elements on top of portalled elements.

```
// example of annoying layering
```

If you don't have a good system in place if you're not careful you'll see the `zIndex` prop bleeding into all corners of your layered components as escape hatches...
and unhappy consumers needing to figure out how to workaround it.

What if our system handled layering concerns [removing the need for escape hatches]?

```
// example of layering but not painful
```

# Margin and layouts

Using margins is simple enough for a single experience,
used in a single area of your application.
But things get nefarious when that single experience now needs to scale to fit other use cases,
in other areas.

```
// example of using margin and then trying to use use it elsewhere and getting burned
```

Words about moving this to parents but then also using flex box directly and its dumb.

```
// example of defaults being dumb
```

What if our system had sensible layout abstractions [and disallowed margins]?

```
// example of a sensible abstraction
```

# More than just systems

1. It's about bringing everyone on the journey
1. Make UI simple and focus on the hard problems
1. The best systems in the world mean nothing if everyone doesn't buy in
1. Need supporting tooling and abstractions
1. Nested styles affect entropy of the system
