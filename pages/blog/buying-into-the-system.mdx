Believe it or not I play ice hockey for fun in Sydney,
Australia.
The higher the competitive ladder you climb the more common it is to have your coach define and apply systems to the way the team plays.
Whether you're attacking or defending there are systems in place ready to execute at any given moment.
In some ways this is a pretty fitting analogy for software development,
except we replace the competitive ladder with scale,
the coach with an engineering manager or architect,
and systems,
well,
systems still work.
When you're a prospect and being scouted the coach will always push for you to ["buy into their system"](https://www.ncsasports.org/blog/2014/07/28/buy-program/),
teams in software development aren't all that different,
truly.
We all want to be aligned so we can execute with precision and speed.

What systems could we define to make UI development easy?
Let's dig into detractors that limit us from getting to that pro level of systems and some thoughts about what we can do with them.

# Boxes, borders, and focus

Today most web developers use `box-sizing: border-box` enabling [the alternative box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model#the_alternative_css_box_model) to simplify how you think about the size of an element rendered in the viewport.
Set an elements width to `100px` and it does exactly what you think it would.
But even with the alternative box model things can still be harder than we'd like them to be.
Borders can be pretty easy to get started with,
but use them with multiple elements and they start behaving a little nefarious.
Let me show you.

```
// example here showing a menu with left border for selected
```

You might be thinking,
"Douges, this is easy mate!
You can work around this by ..." and honestly you're not wrong.
But let's look at another example first.

```
// tabs border example needing to overlay
```



1. Example of border complexity with padding
1. UI can work with or against itself
1. Example of border complexity with multiple borders
1. Outline for focus state is better than box shadow because of the change of box shadow and focus, less likely for border

# Interaction states and backgrounds

1. Interaction state explosion
1. Example of interaction state simplification
1. Moving towards O(1) decision making

# System interfaces and unintentional bleeds

1. APIs bleeding through the system (for consumers, for maintainers)
1. Take a simple tooltip and apply it to your system
1. Zindex wars


# Layouts, text, and alignment

1. Simplifying layout concerns with primitives and simply API (do things one way instead of multiple ways)
1. Abstraction CSS layout with powerful defaults to make it easy for everyone
1. Capsize to cut down text and make 2px padding mean 2px
1. Responsibility and concerns
1. Margins shouldn't be used anymore outside a set of specific scenarios
1. Gap is perfect for layout
1. Nested styles affect entropy of the system

# More than just systems

1. It's about bringing everyone on the journey
1. Make UI simple and focus on the hard problems
1. The best systems in the world mean nothing if everyone doesn't buy in
1. Need supporting tooling and abstractions
