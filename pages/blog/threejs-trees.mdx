I've been working on a [point & click game](https://twitter.com/itsdouges/status/1583776108943904769?s=20&t=u20fJ2AtyC5wih8fVl20Yg) using ThreeJS (...technically React Three Fiber) and I've gotten to the stage where I want to start filling out the environment.
I found this [awesome tutorial by Pontus Karlsson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iASMFba7GeI) going into detail of how to make fluffy stylized trees,
they look _fantastic_!

Unfortunately for me this tutorial was made for Unity 3D...
not ThreeJS!
After a few days of [posting on Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsdouges/status/1587314407520235520) about it I've mostly figured it out,
check it out!

<Complete />

While my trees don't look as impressive I'm still pretty chuffed for how they turned out.
Keep reading for how I did it!
Things are going to get technical fast so if you have knowledge of:

- 3D modelling
- ThreeJS
- GLSL shaders; and
- Math

Then everything will make more sense,
but if you don't have the knowledge don't worry!
I'll explain as we go on.

# Creating the tree model

# Billboarding the foliage

# Cutting the foliage out with alpha maps

# Blowing wind onto the foliage
