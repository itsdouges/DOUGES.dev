I've been working on a [point & click game](https://twitter.com/itsdouges/status/1583776108943904769?s=20&t=u20fJ2AtyC5wih8fVl20Yg) using ThreeJS and I've gotten to the stage where I want to start filling out the environment.
I found this awesome tutorial by [Pontus Karlsson](https://www.youtube.com/user/Pomperi) going into detail of how to make fluffy stylized trees...

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>
  <iframe
    width="560"
    height="315"
    style={{ maxWidth: '100%' }}
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iASMFba7GeI"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  />
</div>

...and they look _fantastic_.
Unfortunately for me though this tutorial was made for Unity 3D...
not ThreeJS!
After a few days of [posting on Twitter](https://twitter.com/itsdouges/status/1587314407520235520) about it I've mostly figured it out.

EXAMPLE HERE

While my trees don't look as impressive I'm still pretty chuffed for how they turned out.
Keep reading for how I did it!
Things are going to get technical fast so if you have knowledge of:

- 3D modelling
- ThreeJS
- GLSL shaders; and
- Math

Then everything will make more sense,
but if you don't have the knowledge don't worry!
I'll explain as we go on.

# Creating the tree model

# Billboarding the foliage

# Cutting the foliage out with alpha maps

# Blowing wind onto the foliage
