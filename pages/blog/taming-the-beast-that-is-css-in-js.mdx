CSS-in-JS is awesome.
When it was gaining traction I remember how freeing it was to use it â€“
in a time when [custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) weren't widely available they allowed us to create rich dynamic experiences right inside JavaScript!
Even better being able to consume a component library from [NPM](https://npmjs.com) without needing inane bundler configuration was made into a reality,
just import and go!

While working at [Atlassian](https://atlassian.com) I've had the privilage to work on the [Atlassian Design System](https://atlassian.design/) which leans heavily on CSS-in-JS to author styles.
During this time I've seen components styled with [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction),
styles defined using strings & objects,
and the costs you wouldn't immediately think about such as performance gotchas,
difficulty in statically analyzing style declarations,
and evolution stagnation.

What if we could improve how we use [emotion] without needing to jump to another library [yet]?

# Colors of the rainbow

One of the benefits of CSS-in-JS is that it is very flexible,
however that is also one of its biggest drawbacks.
The experiences we write today are very dynamic,
different appearances,
states,
and sizes,
with a few different ways to turn these on and off.
One common way I've seen combines styles using conditional object spreads but given a large enough prop set you're at risk of combinatorial explosion!
Also consider that over time a component could go through multiple engineers,
even teams!

Let's have a play and see what that looks like,
press the button to add more permutations!

<ExampleContainer>
  <DynamicStyles />
</ExampleContainer>

It is increasingly more complex to understand this declaration both as a human and static analysis tool!
Styles returned from a function [are these styles?] and indirection from pass-through arguments/nested styles results in the link between input and prop usage being blurry at best.

# Pulling back from infinity

As a codebase grows I find myself wanting to automate away all of the nitty gritty,
and work towards the holy grail of code consistency.
Amusingly however if you take the code above it turns out not having clear call sites for style declarations and complex style combination makes it difficult,
almost impossible to successfully lint and evolve the written styles.
In my opinion it also makes styles harder to reason about.

If we could come up with a list of "goals" to write the best CSS (in JS) what would they be?
My list includes:

- Clear call sites
- Typed declarations
- Easily scanned and understood by engineers
- Encourages statically declared styles
- One way to style

To enact these we could set some constraints.
My list of constraints ends up being:

- Use CSS prop
- Use JS objects
- Styles must be declared in the top level scope
- Styles can't be imported/exported
- Styles can't be nested
- Styles can't be composed together [in their own declarations]

Applying these constraints to the example above it looks like this:

<ExampleContainer>
  <ConstrainStyles />
</ExampleContainer>

If you're feeling what I'm feeling you'll notice the output of this appears very similar to how you'd use CSS modules!
This isn't a coincidence.

# Tying it all together

Imposing constraints correlates to better outcomes in code even if it isn't immediately obvious.
Let's walk through a few examples of what is improved because of the constraints we've applied.

## Performance

Let's start with the more interesting aspect around performance.
These constraints mean less styles are generated when rendered on the server!

<ExampleContainer>
  <AvatarExample />
</ExampleContainer>

Notice there is a style declaration for every unique avatar,
versus a single one when the constraints are applied.
We can extrapolate this further with the knowledge that this is true for styles on the client,
whereby only a finite amount of styles will ever be generated in a session and always before user interaction.

## Code analysis

Linting falls under this bucket.
Style declarations written with these constraints are clear and simple,
so simple in fact that statically analysing them can be done exhaustively.
This is fantastic for the fact that you can write some very powerful rules for how these styles should be written.
Ordering,
disallowed styles,
enforced color usage,
even through to controlling how they are dynamically applied through CSS prop.

<ExampleContainer>
  <CodeAnalysis />
</ExampleContainer>

## Code evolution

A logical next step when the code your write is easily staticly analyzable is that you can change it at scale.
Let's say we've decided that the library we're using isn't performance enough so we decide to move to a compile time solution.
We're now in a great position because it's very easy to automate the transformation!

Here's an example where we transform the code to use the a library that creates styles at build time: [vanilla-extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/).

<ExampleContainer>
  <CodemodStyles />
</ExampleContainer>

Because we know what the floor is,
where static styles flow [CSS prop],
and where dynamic styles flow [inline styles],
we're in complete control.

# Bigger than just styling

Hopefully you've found this read as interesting as I did when I first starting reshaping how we style our experiences.
Finding constraints to apply to the code we write applies to more than just styling our experiences however!

Next time you're deep in your code base think through what opportunities might arise if you applied more constraints to how you write your state management,
your components,
APIs,
even features that you ship [or won't ship].
You'll be suprised at what opportunities arise!
All the best.
