TypeScript is a typed superset of Javascript that compiles to plain Javascript.
TypeScript supports the ability for consumers to transform code from one form to another,
similar to how Babel does it with plugins.

## The basics

A transformer when boiled down is essentially a function that takes and returns some piece of code,
for example:

```
const Transformer = code => code;
```

The difference though is that instead of code being of type string -
it is actually in the form of an abstract syntax tree (AST),
described below.
With it we can do powerful things like updating,
replacing,
adding & deleting nodes.

## What is a abstract syntax tree

Abstract Syntax Trees, or ASTs, are a data structure that describes the code that has been parsed. When working with ASTs in TypeScript I'd strongly recommend using an AST explorer - such as ts-ast-viewer.com.

Using such a tool we can see that the following code:

```
function hello() {
  console.log('world');
}
```
