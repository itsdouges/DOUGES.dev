# Affecting the foliage with wind

The icing on the cake for this effect is to have the foliage be affected by wind,
and we can emulate it by rotating the offset by an amount.
Previously we moved the vertex by adding values to it but we can also rotate by multiplying it with a rotation matrix.

I'm not smart enough to know the formulas off by heart but there are resources we can use to get them such
as [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_two_dimensions).
We then use the rotation matrices on the vertex position,
remember we can apply this to any coordinate space!

Because of the billboard-like effect we're using in the shader how we apply rotation is important for the wind to look great.
Playing with the example above rotating the position in local space results in a wacky rotation,
and if you rotate in view space and apply the rotation to the offset instead of the position you'll see a very similar result!

Applying the rotation in view space so it is relative to the camera looks to be the best option!
Let's run with that.
Now all that's left is to figure out a formula for the wind so we can apply different rotations over time to the foliage.
For that we will use a few variables and functions:

- `normal`, supplied by Three.js, used to know the direction a vertex is facing. Vertices facing up should be more affected by wind.
- `position`, supplied by Three.js, used to offset the rotation value for varied rotations; and
- `u_windTime`, supplied by us, the total time elapsed in seconds
- `cos()` / `sin()`, inbuilt functions, ensures that the value from `u_windTime` stays between a certain range

Using these it's just a matter of putting them together in a way that suites you!
